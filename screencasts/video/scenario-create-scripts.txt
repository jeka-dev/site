# Let's create some basic scripts using JeKa
- Open intelliJ -> Create new base script

# A hello script is already generated
# Let's execute it on terminal
- Terminal: jeka hello -> "Hello World"
- Terminal: jeka hello name=Jeka

# Let's modify the source code
- java editor: change "Hello" by "Hi"
- Terminal: jeka hello -> "Hi World"
# Change has been taken into account immediately

# We can also launch or debug it directly from IDE
- Run directly
- Add breackpoint + debug method -> highlight value of 'greetings"'

# Configure the name permanently
- jeka.properties -> @script.name=Maria
- terminal : jeka hello -> "Hi Maria"

# Let's add a dependencies
- add @JkInjectClasspath with lalyos and crt+space and "sync iml"
- add public method asciiart() using FigletFont class to create ascci hello world
- Terminal: jeka asciiart
# There can have many methods declared on a single KBean class.
# Let's list them
- Terminal: jeka : --doc (list method and field available for the default KBean)

# Let's complexify the script structure
- create utils.Utils class add public static method asciiartize()
- Refactor Script + run
# There is no constraint about structure and class count

# Let's Add a second script
- add guava dependency
- Create Script2 with method 'help' that repeat 3 time "Help ! "
- terminal: jeka --doc ->
# Two Scripts co-exist but the default one remains Script in respect to the alphabetic order
# We need to specify where 'help' method is coming from as it is not contained in the default KBean.
- terminal: jeka script2: help

# Let's make KBeans interact
- create init() method in script2 that change the value of "name" to "My Friends"
- terminal: jeka asciiart -> Hello World
# The script2 has not been initied cause it is not the initBean (which is the first found in jeka-src)
- terminal: jeka --inspect  -> outline dafoult kbean and init
# We need to do it explicitly
- terminal: jeka script: asciiartize script2: -> hello my friends
# We can set the properties to initilize script2 at each tile
- ide -> jeka.properties -> add @script2=

# Explore existing KBean from the cli
jeka admin: --doc
jeka project: --doc

# Explore from IDE
- open tool
- Execute and show source from local bean
- Execute base: depTree
