- Add "JekA" just at bottom of the logo. Text width must match with logo base.

- Reduce height of <bloquote section "Can Java still....."
  Add a bg image like as in <section style="background-image:url('img/black_bg.svg'); background-size:cover; background-attachment:fixed;">
  The blockquote gigcaption does not render well

- Make Youtube embedded video render well in small device

- In supported techno, add and feet image from 3rdPrarty: git, kotlin, maven, nexus (images have been added in /img)

- Change the palette of demo-application-home-banner_dark.jpg, it does not look consistent with the other parts.
  I prefer colorq in demo-application-home-bg-right.png

- Time to time, links are not activated when hover "still need help" and "contribute"  avatar images.
